# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Unofficial Aniyomi Extensions

This repository contains some unofficial extensions for the [Aniyomi](https://github.com/jmir1/aniyomi) app.

# Usage

Unofficial extension sources can't be downloaded or updated via the main Aniyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

## Downloads

To download the APK files, they are available in the [`repo` branch](https://github.com/jmir1/unofficial-aniyomi-extensions/tree/repo/apk).

# Requests

Source requests here are meant as up-for-grabs for any developer, thus it's impossible to provide a time estimation for any of them. Furthermore, some sites are impossible to do, usually because of various technical reasons.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Just open a PR with any source you made and I might add it :)
